# **GatoBot Public, cos private is not done yet :]**

**Usage:** <br />
Install Python 3 if it is not installed already <br />
Open CMD/Terminal <br />
Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` <br />
Put your bots token into the .env file <br />
Run `gato-bot.py` <br />
The rest will be easy to understand!

**Current Features:**

`Debug [arg]` Repeats the argument into chat <br />
`Version` Tells you the current version of gato-bot <br />
`Ping` Tells you the ping of the bot  <br />

**Please Note** <br />
This version is far from as good as the private release, and is not fit for use rn. Currently only features debug commands (Maybe could be used as a base?)
